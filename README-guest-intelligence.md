## 4. AI-Powered Behaviors

### Sentiment Analysis Engine

**Automatic Classification:**
- **Critical Complaints**: Keywords like "disgusting," "terrible," "worst," "unacceptable"
- **Moderate Issues**: "disappointed," "expected better," "could improve"
- **Positive Feedback**: "excellent," "amazing," "exceeded expectations"
- **Neutral**: General comments without emotional indicators

**Real-time Processing:**
- Email/chat messages analyzed within 30 seconds
- Phone call transcripts processed via speech-to-text
- Review platform monitoring (TripAdvisor, Google, etc.)
- Social media mention tracking

### Recovery Predictor Algorithm

**Scoring Factors (0-100 scale):**
- Complaint Severity: Critical (-30), Moderate (-15), Low (-5)
- Resolution Speed: Same day (+20), Next day (+10), >48hrs (-10)
- Guest Value: Platinum (+15), Gold (+10), Silver (+5)
- Historical Satisfaction: Previous NPS 9-10 (+10), 7-8 (+5), <7 (-5)

**Automated Suggestions:**
- Score <70: "Offer complimentary amenity + personal apology"
- Score 70-85: "Acknowledge issue + follow-up call"
- Score >85: "Standard resolution + note in profile"

### Duplicate Detection & Merging

**Matching Criteria:**
1. **Exact Match**: Email address or phone number
2. **Fuzzy Match**: Name similarity + date proximity (90% confidence)
3. **Behavioral Match**: Same credit card + similar booking patterns

**Auto-merge Conditions:**
- Same email across OTA and direct bookings
- Phone number match with <5% name variation
- Credit card fingerprint + arrival date match

**Manual Review Queue:**
- Names with 70-89% similarity
- Different emails but same phone
- Corporate vs. personal bookings for same individual

- **Alert Orange** (#F59E0B): Moderate issues, pending actions, warnings
- **Critical Red** (#EF4444): Urgent complaints, overdue items, errors

**Background Tones:**
- **Soft Gray** (#F8FAFC): Main background, neutral spaces
- **Warm White** (#FEFEFE): Card backgrounds, content areas
- **Subtle Blue** (#F0F9FF): VIP member highlighting

- **Small spacing**: 8px (related items)
- **Medium spacing**: 16px (component groups)
- **Large spacing**: 24px (sections)
- **XL spacing**: 32px (major layout areas)

### Animation & Interaction

**Transition Principles:**
- **Duration**: 200ms for micro-interactions, 300ms for page transitions
- **Easing**: ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Animations enhance but don't block functionality

**Specific Animations:**
- **Loading States**: Subtle shimmer effect on skeleton screens
- **Status Changes**: Smooth color transition when complaint marked resolved
- **Hover States**: 0.15s elevation increase on interactive cards
- **Modal Appearance**: 0.2s fade + scale from 95% to 100%
